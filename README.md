# SQL-Based Data Analytics Roadmap

This repository provides a structured roadmap for conducting Data Analysis using SQL, focusing on real-world business scenarios. It is designed for data analysts and professionals who want to apply SQL to explore datasets, generate insights, and support decision-making.

This roadmap is divided into two major phases: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Advanced Analytics. Each SQL script provides a distinct analytical function and can be adapted to your own dataset and business context.

## Overview

The roadmap consists of the following sections:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** For understanding the structure, dimensions, and magnitude of your data.
- **Advanced Analytics:** For performing deeper trend, performance, and segmentation analyses.

Each script file is independent and can be customized by updating the schema and table names as per your database.

## Section Details

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Database Exploration**: Discover available schemas, tables, and record counts.
2. **Dimensions Exploration**: List unique values, frequency counts, and cardinality of categorical fields.
3. **Date Range Exploration**: Check for completeness, min/max ranges, and gaps in date fields.
4. **Measures Exploration**: Summarize numerical columns using aggregates like SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX.
5. **Magnitude Analysis**: Identify top and bottom contributors based on selected metrics.
6. **Ranking Analysis**: Apply SQL ranking functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK) to generate ranked outputs.

### Advanced Analytics

7. **Change Over Time Analysis**: Compare metrics over different time periods (monthly, quarterly, yearly).
8. **Cumulative Analysis**: Calculate running totals and cumulative distributions.
9. **Performance Analysis**: Analyze actual values against defined targets or benchmarks.
10. **Data Segmentation**: Segment users, products, or orders based on behavior or attributes.
11. **Part to Whole Analysis**: Compute proportions or contributions of categories to the total.
12. **Customer Reporting**: Generate detailed reports for individual or grouped customers.
13. **Product Reporting**: Generate detailed reports for individual or grouped products.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sql-data-analytics-roadmap.git
   cd sql-data-analytics-roadmap
   ```

2. Open any `.sql` file in your SQL editor (MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, BigQuery Console, etc.).

3. Modify the table and column names according to your database schema.

4. Run queries step-by-step to perform analysis or integrate into your BI workflow.

## Requirements

- A SQL-supported RDBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, BigQuery)
- Access to a structured dataset for analysis
- A SQL editor or BI tool (optional for visualization)

## Best Practices

- Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for modular query writing.
- Comment your code for clarity and future reference.
- Validate missing or inconsistent data before analyzing.
- Test queries with filters to verify outputs at smaller scales.
